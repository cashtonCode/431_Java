/*
Program 1 (25 pts)

Write a Java program to get the average of a collection/assortment of numbers. The numbers can be input from the console or a file and the result output to the console or a file (Your choice). Provide sufficient console instructions to anyone running the program. If there are constraints that the user needs to be aware of, make sure to communicate these to the user.  The user should not be adversely constrained by number of elements or type of data (integer and decimal numbers should work). Be sure to handle and test invalid input.

Your program should use the following features, constructs:

a variable name, an aggregate data type such as an array (a string will not satisfy this requirement), an expression and assignment statement, a statement-level control structure such as a loop, a subprogram, error handling, and this project should run on the local Linux system.

Submit your code as instructed. Submit by email screen prints of your testing, and the associated input and output.

Due at class start time (by e-mail and printout); turn in a printout of your source code, screen prints of your testing (screen changed from black), and a printout of your input and the program output. Your printout should show that you sufficiently tested the program. E-mail a copy of your source code (as a separate file), screen prints of your testing, and your input and output. Font size should be 12 or larger.
